    STREX Instructions

    Model accesses performed by strex specifically.

    This is necessary as Unicorn performs an MMIO read access while angr just moves
    the value 0 into the destination register

    For example, the instruction STREX R2, R1, [R0] in
    - angr: just stores the value 0 in R2
    - unicorn/qemu: reads from address [R0] during the instruction

    The way we handle this is by assigning a passthrough model returning the last written
    value to let unicorn figure out whether the value has stayed the same and thus whether
    the store operation has succeeded.

    NOTE: This may be a failure case in nieche cases where the firmware requires the operation
    to fail (in something like a low-level hardware funtionality debug case). However, this
    should never really occur and can still be handled manually.

    To perform the modeling, extract the memory location from the instruction, evaluate it,
    and assign a model for the address.
