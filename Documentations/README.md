# Documentation structures
In this folder we prepared several documentations to illustrate the details of some of Fuzzware's core features (modeling and handlers). Besides, we also included two documentations to instruct how to debug while using Fuzzware and how to extend Fuzzware to new architectures. Brief summaries are listed in the table below.
